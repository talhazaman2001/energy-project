☁️ Designing and implementing a scalable and secure Smart Energy Monitoring System using AWS Cloud services was both a rewarding and challenging experience.
Energy consumption tracking and analysis in real-time is crucial for cost optimisation and sustainability. 

Traditional energy meters are static, provide limited insights, and are hard to monitor remotely. Businesses and homeowners need an efficient way to track energy use, identify wastage, and optimise consumption patterns.

This system aims to monitor, track, and analyse energy consumption in real-time for homes, industries, or office buildings, enabling data-driven insights for optimising energy use.
